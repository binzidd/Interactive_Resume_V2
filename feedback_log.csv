His certifications in Tableau, Alteryx, AWS, and Snowflake demonstrate a robust skill set in data visualization, data processing, cloud computing, and data warehousing, respectively.

**Experience**: Unfortunately, the specific roles and years of Binay's professional experience are not provided in the excerpt you've shared. To give a comprehensive answer, I would need more details about his past positions and responsibilities.

**Project Name**: The resume excerpt does not include specific project names or descriptions. Without this information, I cannot provide an overview of how Binay has used his skills in a project context.

Based on his certifications and the summary hinting at him being a ""Results-driven Senior Manager,"" Binay can be a value add to a team by leveraging his expertise in data analytics and management to drive strategic decisions and improve operational efficiency. His knowledge of Tableau and Alteryx suggests he is adept at data visualization and advanced analytics, which are crucial for interpreting complex data sets and providing actionable insights.

If the position in question is technology-focused, Binay's certifications and implied experience with AWS and Snowflake position him well for roles that require cloud-based data solutions and data warehousing expertise. For a finance-related position, his data analytics skills would be invaluable for financial modeling, forecasting, and reporting.

Since the resume does not contain specific AI-related projects, it is recommended to check Binay's LinkedIn and GitHub profiles for more detailed information on his professional projects and technical skills, especially if the role requires AI expertise."
